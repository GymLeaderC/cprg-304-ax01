Getting Started — Cloning the Repository in Eclipse
Prerequisites

Eclipse IDE installed on your machine
Git installed and available on your system PATH

Steps
1. Copy the Repository URL

Navigate to the repository on GitHub/GitLab/etc.
Click the green Code button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.

Open Eclipse and select your desired workspace.
From the menu bar, go to File → Import.

3. Select the Git Import Option

In the Import dialog, expand the Git folder.
Select Projects from Git and click Next.

4. Choose "Clone URI"

Select Clone URI and click Next.

Paste the repository URL into the URI field. Eclipse will auto-populate the Host and Repository Path fields.
Enter your Git credentials (username and password/token) if prompted.
Click Next.

6. Select the Branch

Select the branch(es) you want to clone (typically main or develop).
Click Next.

7. Choose a Local Destination

Troubleshooting

Git not recognized? Ensure Git is installed and Eclipse is configured to find it under Window → Preferences → Team → Git → Configuration.
Authentication failed? If your repository uses two-factor authentication, use a personal access token instead of your password.
Project not building? Check that your JDK/JRE is properly configured under Window → Preferences → Java → Installed JREs.
